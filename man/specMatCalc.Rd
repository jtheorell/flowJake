\title{Calculating the matrix used for spectral unmixing}
\usage{
specMatCalc(compControls, groupNames, autoFluoName)
}
\arguments{
\item{compControls}{A flowSet containing all the single stained and
unstained files necessary to create an spectral unmixing matrix.}

\item{groupNames}{A character vector containing strings common to the groups
of non-autofluoresence compControls that could be present. If for example
all antibodies single stains are anti-mouse bead-based the dead cell marker
is stained PBMC, and the files congruently either have a prefix containing
"Bead" or "PBMC", then the vector should be c("Bead", "PBMC"). The system
is not case specific.}

\item{autoFluoName}{The sample name of the autofluorescence control.}
}
\value{
A data frame with each row representing a fluorochrome or
or autofluorescence and each column representing a detector.
}
\description{
This algoritm takes a flowSet containing single-stained controls and
negative controls, including an autofluorescence control and estimates the
unmixing for all fluorescent variables.
}
\examples{
# Load suitable compensation controls. NB! If these originate from different
#sample types, such as beads and PBMC, there should be a negative control for
#each group and the names should reflect this, so that all PBMC samples would
#be called PBMC_unstained, PBMC_DCM, etc.
data(compCtrls)

#If  the dataset contains cell controls, make sure that the cell population
#interest dominates FSC-A, as the data highest peak in this channel will be
#used.

# And run the function
specMat <- specMatCalc(compCtrls, groupNames = "Beads_", autoFluoName =
"PBMC_autofluo.fcs")
