#' Calculating the matrix used for spectral unmixing
#'
#'
#' This algoritm takes a flowSet containing single-stained controls and
#' negative controls, including an autofluorescence control and estimates the
#' unmixing for all fluorescent variables.
#' @param compControls A flowSet containing all the single stained and
#' unstained files necessary to create an spectral unmixing matrix.
#' @param groupNames A character vector containing strings common to the groups
#' of non-autofluoresence compControls that could be present. If for example
#' all antibodies single stains are anti-mouse bead-based the dead cell marker
#' is stained PBMC, and the files congruently either have a prefix containing
#' "Bead" or "PBMC", then the vector should be c("Bead", "PBMC"). The system
#' is not case specific.
#' @param autoFluoName The sample name of the autofluorescence control.
#' @return A data frame with each row representing a fluorochrome or
#' or autofluorescence and each column representing a detector.
#' @importFrom BiocGenerics colnames ncol
#' @examples
#' # Load suitable compensation controls. NB! If these originate from different
#' #sample types, such as beads and PBMC, there should be a negative control for
#' #each group and the names should reflect this, so that all PBMC samples would
#' #be called PBMC_unstained, PBMC_DCM, etc.

#' #interest dominates FSC-A, as the data highest peak in this channel will be
