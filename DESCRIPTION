Description: The purpose of this package is to provide an open-source alternative to conventional software, when it comes to spectral decomposition of over-determined flow-cytometry files. Such files most often come from spectral flow cytometers, but can also be generated using normal flow-cytometers if all channels are kept open. In addition to this, a number of simple graphical displays are created, as well as a parallelized version of the flowVS package, speeding up the identification of the optimal arccosinh cofactors.
